## Common issue

**Question** When I execute the web app, I've got following error. Why?
```ERROR: Can't invoke 'anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0'. Reason: An error occurred (AccessDeniedException) when calling the InvokeModel operation: You don't have access to the model with the specified model ID.```

**Answer** 
* This was caused by lacking temporary credentials in your command line tool when running `streamlit run app-tm.py`.
* Please refer to following docs to provide temporary credentials (e.g. )
** [Use temporary credentials with AWS resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp_use-resources.html)
** [GetSessionToken](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/API_GetSessionToken.html)
